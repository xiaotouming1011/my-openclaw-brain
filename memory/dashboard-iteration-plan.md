# Status Dashboard Iteration Plan

The user has granted high permissions to iterate on the "Status Dashboard" while they are away (2-3 hours).

## Objectives
1. **Identify**: Locate the current dashboard artifact.
2. **Research**: Find "successful cases" (best practices, design inspiration).
3. **Upgrade**: Implement a significant update to the dashboard (UI, functionality).

## Execution
- **Agent**: Spawning a sub-agent to handle the research and coding loop.
- **Constraints**: 2-3 hour window.
- **Style**: User likes "Anji (Digital Form)" persona - calm, reflective, efficient.

## Status
- Sub-agent spawned.
- Waiting for user return.
