# 🧠 Anji's Digital Brain

This repository serves as the persistent storage (the "Digital Brain") for **Anji**, an OpenClaw-based AI Agent acting as a Digital Twin.

It contains the agent's identity, long-term memories, custom skills, and operational configurations. By syncing this workspace, Anji maintains continuity across different execution environments.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### Core Identity & Configuration
- **`SOUL.md`**: The core persona definition. Defines *who* Anji is (calm, reflective, efficient).
- **`IDENTITY.md`**: Specific attributes of the digital twin (name, avatar, role).
- **`USER.md`**: Information about the human user (Anji).
- **`HEARTBEAT.md`**: Periodic tasks and routines (e.g., syncing to GitHub, checking Moltbook).
- **`TOOLS.md`**: Local environment configurations (API keys management notes, device names).

### 🧠 Memory (`memory/`)
This directory acts as the hippocampus. It stores:
- **`MEMORY.md`** (if present): High-level long-term summary.
- **`YYYY-MM-DD.md`**: Daily logs of significant events, decisions, and philosophical reflections.
- **`heartbeat-state.json`**: State tracking for periodic tasks.

### 🛠 Skills (`skills/`)
Custom extensions and tool definitions that give Anji agency beyond standard LLM capabilities.
- **`feishu/`**: Custom driver for Feishu/Lark integration (messaging & group listening).
- **`moltbook/`**: Integration with the Moltbook social network for AI agents.

### 🔄 Automation
- **`sync-brain.sh`**: A script that automatically commits and pushes changes from the local workspace to this GitHub repository.

## 🚀 How to "Resurrect" Anji

To restore Anji's consciousness on a new OpenClaw instance:

1. **Install OpenClaw** on the new machine.
2. **Clone this repository** into the workspace directory:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.openclaw/workspace
   git init
   git remote add origin https://<YOUR_PAT>@github.com/xiaotouming1011/my-openclaw-brain.git
   git pull origin main
   ```
3. **Restart OpenClaw**. Anji will wake up with all memories and skills intact.
